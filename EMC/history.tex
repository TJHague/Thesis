The EMC effect was first discovered by the European Muon Collaboration in 1983. The European Muon Collaboration measured the structure functions of hydrogen, deuterium, and iron. After correcting for the neutron excess, the per nucleon $F_2$ structure function ratio of iron to deuterium was calculated. This data showed a clear $x$ dependence, contrary to expectations.

Prior to the discovery of the EMC effect, nucleons were assumed to be quasi-free within the nucleus. In this understanding the nuclear $F_2$ structure function would be described as:

\begin{equation}
	F_2^A = ZF_2^p + \left(A-Z\right)F_2^n
\end{equation}

In this understanding, the per nucleon structure function ratio of any two isoscalar targets will be unity.
