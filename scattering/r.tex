If we instead approach DIS as the production and absorption of a virtual photon by a parton we can extract a different structure function $R=\sigma_L/\sigma_T$, referred to as photonuclear R. That is, the ratio of the cross sections for absorbing longitudinal photons to transverse photons.

We can write the DIS cross section in terms of these cross sections as

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2\sigma}{d\Omega dE^\prime}\left(E,E^\prime,\theta\right) = \Gamma\left[\sigma_T\left(x,Q^2\right)+\epsilon\sigma_L\left(x,Q^2\right)\right]
\end{equation}

In this equation $\Gamma$ is the flux of transverse virtual photons and $\epsilon$ is the relative flux of longitudinal virtual photons. These are defined by

\begin{equation}
	\Gamma = \frac{\alpha KE^\prime}{2\pi^2Q^2E_0\left(1-\epsilon\right)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\epsilon = \frac{1}{1+2\left(1+\nu^2/Q^2\right)\tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}
\end{equation}

Here, $K$ is the laboratory photon energy

\begin{equation}
	K = \frac{W^2-M^2}{2M}
\end{equation}

In this schema we find that:

\begin{equation}
	F_1 = \frac{F_2\left(1+Q^2/\nu^2\right)}{2x\left(1+R\right)}
\end{equation}

Substituting this into our DIS cross section equation, we can eliminate $F_1$. This also makes it clear that we can easily access the $F_2$ structure functions by measuring cross section ratios.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2\sigma}{d\Omega dE^\prime}\left(E,E^\prime,\theta\right) = \frac{4\alpha^2\left(E^\prime\right)}{Q^4}\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)F_2\left[\frac{1}{\nu}+\frac{\left(1+Q^2/\nu^2\right)}{xM\left(1+R\right)}\tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

If we measure the cross section ratios of two different targets, we find:

%\begin{equation}
%	\frac{\sigma_A}{\sigma_B} = \frac{F_2^A\left[1 + }{â€¢}
%\end{equation}

Historical data suggests that photonuclear R has no nuclear dependence to within $10\%$. If we assume that that there is no nuclear dependence, this equation simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sigma_A}{\sigma_B} = \frac{F_2^A}{F_2^B}
\end{equation}

By measuring the cross section ratios of targets in the DIS region, we can easily access the nuclear structure functions of the targets.
