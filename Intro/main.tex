Prior to \textbf{EMC EFFECT STUFF} it was taken for granted that quark distributions were independent of the surrounding nucleus. The European Muon Collaboration (EMC) found this not to be the case. They found that quark distributions are different in a nucleus than in a nucleon. The ratio of the Iron to Deuterium $F_2$ structure functions was found to greatly deviate from unity.

EMC EMC EMC. $A=3$ nuclear structure data is critical to understanding the nature of the EMC effect.

The MARATHON experiment studied the cross section ratios of the He3/H2, H3/H2, H3/He3. This data aims to provide a more complete understanding of the EMC effect and nuclear structure. In this thesis, I will describe the analysis of the He3 EMC effect. The next two chapters will provide an overview of electron-nucleon Deep Inelastic Scattering and the EMC effect. Chapter 4 will describe the experimental setup used in Hall A of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). Chapter 5 will go over the analysis of the cross section ratio. Finally, Chapter 6 will present the results of my analysis.
