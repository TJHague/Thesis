abstract = {The techniques for the optical calibration of Jefferson Labs large-acceptance magnetic hadron spectrometer, BigBite, have been examined. The most consistent and stable results were obtained using a method based on singular value decomposition. In spite of the complexity of the optics, the particles positions and momenta at the target have been precisely reconstructed from the coordinates measured in the detectors by means of a single back-tracing matrix. The technique is applicable to any similar magnetic spectrometer and any particle type. For 0.55 GeV/c protons, we have established a vertex resolution of 1.2 cm, angular resolutions of 7 mrad and 13 mrad (in-plane and out-of-plane, respectively), and a relative momentum resolution of 1.6{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Results are presented on the ratios of the deep inelastic muon-nucleus cross sections for carbon, copper and tin nuclei to those measured on deuterium. The data confirm that the structure functions of the nucleon measured in nuclei are different from those measured on quasi-free nucleons in deuterium. The kinematic range of the data is such that 〈Q2〉 ∼ 5 GeV2 at x ∼ 0.03, increasing to 〈Q2〉 ∼ 35 GeV2 for x ∼ 0.65. The measured cross section ratios are less than unity for x ≲ 0.05 and for 0.25 ≲ x {\textless} 0.7. The decrease of the ratio below unity for low x becomes larger as A increases as might be expected from nuclear shadowing. However, this occurs at relatively large values of Q2 (∼ 5 GeV2) indicating that such shadowing is of patrionic origin. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved. Nuclear dynamics at short distances is one of the most fascinating topics of strong interaction physics. The physics of it is closely related to the understanding of the role of the QCD in generating nuclear forces at short distances, as well as of the dynamics of the superdense cold nuclear matter relevant to the interior of neutron stars. The emergence of high-energy electron and proton beams has led to significant recent progress in high-energy nuclear scattering experiments investigating the short-range structure of nuclei. These experiments, in turn, have stimulated new theoretical studies resulting in the observation of several new phenomena specific to the short-range structure of nuclei. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in studies of short-range correlations in nuclei and discuss their importance for advancing our understanding of the dynamics of nuclear interactions at short distances.},

A discussion of the three-nucleon SRC study (3N-SRC) measured by the Jefferson Lab's Hall B and Hall C experiments which showed contradictory results is given and, most importantly, we report a new result from the Hall A E08-014 experiment which was dedicated on studying 3N-SRC. Our high precision 4He/3He cross section ratios at the x {\textgreater} 2 region do not show a 3N-SRC plateau as predicted by the naive SRC model. To further investigate the 3N-SRC as well as the Isospin effect of the SRC, we have designed several approved experiments in Hall A and in Hall C, including the Tritium experiments using the mirror nuclei (3H and 3He) which are currently running in Hall A.},

We review the progress in understanding the nuclear dependence of deep-inelastic scattering reactions and parton distributions-the nuclear EMC effect. While there is now a considerable body of high-quality deep-inelastic data, more work is required to exploit other hard probes with differing sensitivities to quark-flavor and gluon degrees of freedom. A variety of models for the nuclear dependence of structure functions are also considered. Substantial progress has been made in establishing the validity of these models and it is now clear what must be included in any realistic treatment. Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to identify a definitive set of mechanisms that account satisfactorily for the experimental nuclear dependence.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This article reviews our current understanding of how the internal quark structure of a nucleon bound in nuclei differs from that of a free nucleon. We focus on the interpretation of measurements of the EMC effect for valence quarks, a reduction in the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) cross-section ratios for nuclei relative to deuterium, and its possible connection to nucleon-nucleon Short-Range Correlations (SRC) in nuclei. Our review and new analysis (involving the amplitudes of non-nucleonic configurations in the nucleus) of the available experimental and theoretical evidence shows that there is a phenomenological relation between the EMC effect and the effects of SRC that is not an accident. The influence of strongly correlated neutron-proton pairs involving highly virtual nucleons is responsible for both effects. These correlated pairs are temporary high-density fluctuations in the nucleus in which the internal structure of the nucleons is briefly modified. This conclusion needs to be solidified by the future experiments and improved theoretical analyses that are discussed herein.},

abstract = {This well-known introductory textbook gives a uniform presentation of nuclear and particle physics from an experimental point of view. The first part, Analysis, is devoted to disentangling the substructure of matter. This part shows that experiments designed to uncover the substructures of nuclei and nucleons have a similar conceptual basis, and lead to the present picture of all matter being constructed from a small number of elementary building blocks and a small number of fundamental interactions. The second part, Synthesis, shows how the elementary particles may be combined to build hadrons and nuclei. The fundamental interactions, which are responsible for the forces in all systems, become less and less evident in increasingly complex systems. Such systems are in fact dominated by many-body phenomena. A section on neutrino oscillations and one on nuclear matter at high temperatures bridge the field of "nuclear and particle physics" and "modern astrophysics and cosmology". The fourth edition includes new developments, in particular a new section on the double beta decay including a discussion of the possibility for a neutrinoless decay and its implications for the standard model. The concise text is based on lectures held at the University of Heidelberg. It has been translated into many languages and has become a standard reference for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses and includes numerous exercises with worked answers. Book jacket.},

@article{ThomasSRC,
abstract = {In the 35 years since the European Muon Collaboration announced the astonishing result that the valence structure of a nucleus was very different from that of a free nucleon, many explanations have been suggested. The first of the two most promising explanations is based upon the different effects of the strong Lorentz scalar and vector mean fields known to exist in a nucleus on the internal structure of the nucleon-like clusters which occupy shell model states. The second links the effect to the modification of the structure of nucleons involved in short-range correlations, which are far off their mass shell. We explore some of the methods which have been proposed to give complementary information on this puzzle, especially the spin-dependent EMC effect and the isovector EMC effect, both proposed by Clo{\"{e}}t, Bentz and Thomas. It is shown that the predictions for the spin-dependent EMC effect, in particular, differ substantially within the mean-field and short-range correlation approaches. Hence, the measurement of the spin-dependent EMC effect at Jefferson Lab should give us a deeper understanding of the origin of the EMC effect and, indeed, of the structure of atomic nuclei.},

In this context three different but related approaches are presented: Glauber-like rescatterings, Gribov inelastic shadowing and ideas based on high-density Quantum Chromodynamics. Next, different parametrizations of nuclear partonic distributions based on fit analysis to existing data combined with Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution, are reviewed. Finally, a comparison of the different approaches is shown, and a few phenomenological consequences of nuclear shadowing in high-energy nuclear collisions are presented.},

abstract = {By combining the q0→i method for asymptotic sum rules with the P→ method of Fubini and Furlan, we relate the structure functions W2 and W1 in inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering to matrix elements of commutators of currents at almost equal times at infinite momentum. We argue that the infinite-momentum limit for these commutators does not diverge, but may vanish. If the limit is nonvanishing, we predict $\nu$W2($\nu$,q2)→f2($\nu$q2) and W1($\nu$,q2)→f1($\nu$q2) as $\nu$ and q2 tend to. From a similar analysis for neutrino processes, we conclude that at high energies the total neutrino-nucleon cross sections rise linearly with neutrino laboratory energy until nonlocality of the weak current-current coupling sets in. The sum of $\nu$p and $\nu$p cross sections is determined by the equal-time commutator of the Cabibbo current with its time derivative, taken between proton states at infinite momentum. {\textcopyright} 1969 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Inclusive electron scattering data are presented for2H, C, Fe, and Au targets at an incident electron energy of 4.045 GeV for a range of momentum transfers from Q2=1 to 7 (GeV/c)2. Data were taken at Jefferson Laboratory for low values of energy loss, corresponding to values of Bjorken x≳1. The structure functions do not show scaling in x in this range, where inelastic scattering is not expected to dominate the cross section. The data do show scaling, however, in the Nachtmann variable $\xi$. This scaling appears to be the result of Bloom-Gilman duality in the nucleon structure function combined with the Fermi motion of the nucleons in the nucleus. The resulting extension of scaling to larger values of $\xi$ opens up the possibility of accessing nuclear structure functions in the high-x region at lower values of Q2than previously believed.

abstract = {We have carried out an experimental study of the neutron and proton deep-inelastic electromagnetic structure functions. The structure functions were extracted from electron-proton and electron-deuteron differential cross sections measured in three experiments spanning the angles 6°, 10°, 15°, 18°, 19°, 26°, and 34°. We report primarily on the large-angle (15°-34°) measurements. Neutron cross sections were extracted from the deuteron data using an impulse approximation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the nucleon is composed of pointlike constituents. The variation of the cross section with angle suggests that the hypothetical constituents have spin. The data for np, the ratio of the neutron and proton differential cross sections, are in the range 0.25 to 1.0, and are within the limits imposed by the quark model. Detailed studies of the structure functions were made for a range of the scaling variable from =1.3 to =10.0, and for a range of invariant four-momentum transfer Q2 from 1.0 to 20.0 GeV2. These studies indicate that the structure functions approximately scale in the variable, although significant deviations from scaling in are apparent in the region 1.3{\textless}{\textless}3.3. These deviations from scaling are in the same direction and of similar magnitude for both neutron and proton. The interpretation of the data in terms of various theoretical models is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1979 The American Physical Society.},
