abstract = {Deep-inelastic scattering reactions provided the first clear evidence that the quark structure of nucleons and nuclei were significantly different. We review the progress in understanding the nuclear dependence of deep-inelastic scattering reactions and parton distributions-the nuclear EMC effect. While there is now a considerable body of high-quality deep-inelastic data, more work is required to exploit other hard probes with differing sensitivities to quark-flavor and gluon degrees of freedom. A variety of models for the nuclear dependence of structure functions are also considered. Substantial progress has been made in establishing the validity of these models and it is now clear what must be included in any realistic treatment. Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to identify a definitive set of mechanisms that account satisfactorily for the experimental nuclear dependence.},

The measurements find evidence for the existence of a second diffraction minimum for the magnetic form factor at Q2=49.3 fm-2 and for the charge form factor at Q2=62.0 fm-2. Both minima are predicted to exist in the Q2 range accessible by this Jefferson Lab experiment.

@article{ThomasSRC,
abstract = {In the 35 years since the European Muon Collaboration announced the astonishing result that the valence structure of a nucleus was very different from that of a free nucleon, many explanations have been suggested. The first of the two most promising explanations is based upon the different effects of the strong Lorentz scalar and vector mean fields known to exist in a nucleus on the internal structure of the nucleon-like clusters which occupy shell model states. The second links the effect to the modification of the structure of nucleons involved in short-range correlations, which are far off their mass shell. We explore some of the methods which have been proposed to give complementary information on this puzzle, especially the spin-dependent EMC effect and the isovector EMC effect, both proposed by Clo{\"{e}}t, Bentz and Thomas. It is shown that the predictions for the spin-dependent EMC effect, in particular, differ substantially within the mean-field and short-range correlation approaches. Hence, the measurement of the spin-dependent EMC effect at Jefferson Lab should give us a deeper understanding of the origin of the EMC effect and, indeed, of the structure of atomic nuclei.},

Two beam position monitors (BPMs) were necessary to measure the beam position and angle at the target. A new BPM receiver was designed and built to handle the low beam currents (50-100 nA) used for this experiment. Two new super-harps were installed for calibrating the BPMs. In addition to the existing fast raster system, a slow raster system was installed. Before and during the experiment, these new devices were tested and debugged, and their performance was also evaluated. In order to achieve the required accuracy (1-2 mm in position and 1-2 mrad in angle at the target location), the data of the BPMs and harps were carefully analyzed, as well as reconstructing the beam position and angle event by event at the target location. The calculated beam position will be used in the data analysis to accurately determine the kinematics for each event.},

abstract = {A system of modular sealed gas target cells has been developed for use in electron scattering experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). This system was initially developed to complete the MARATHON experiment which required, among other species, tritium as a target material. Thus far, the cells have been loaded with the gas species 3H, 3He, 2H, 1H and 40Ar and operated in nominal beam currents of up to 22.5 $\mu$A in Jefferson Lab's Hall A. While the gas density of the cells at the time of loading is known, the density of each gas varies uniquely when heated by the electron beam. To extract experimental cross sections using these cells, density dependence on beam current of each target fluid must be determined. In this study, data from measurements with several beam currents within the range of 2.5 to 22.5 $\mu$A on each target fluid are presented. Additionally, expressions for the beam current dependent fluid density of each target are developed.},

Data were taken at Jefferson Laboratory for low values of energy loss, corresponding to values of Bjorken x≳1. The structure functions do not show scaling in x in this range, where inelastic scattering is not expected to dominate the cross section. The data do show scaling, however, in the Nachtmann variable $\xi$. This scaling appears to be the result of Bloom-Gilman duality in the nucleon structure function combined with the Fermi motion of the nucleons in the nucleus. The resulting extension of scaling to larger values of $\xi$ opens up the possibility of accessing nuclear structure functions in the high-x region at lower values of Q2than previously believed.

abstract = {The instrumentation in Hall A at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility was designed to study electro- and photo-induced reactions at very high luminosity and good momentum and angular resolution for at least one of the reaction products. The central components of Hall A are two identical high resolution spectrometers, which allow the vertical drift chambers in the focal plane to provide a momentum resolution of better than 2×10-4. A variety of Cherenkov counters, scintillators and lead-glass calorimeters provide excellent particle identification. The facility has been operated successfully at a luminosity well in excess of 1038 cm-2 s-1. The research program is aimed at a variety of subjects, including nucleon structure functions, nucleon form factors and properties of the nuclear medium. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The ratios of inclusive electron scattering cross sections of $^4$He, $^{12}$C, and $^{56}$Fe to $^3$He have been measured for the first time. It is shown that these ratios are independent of $x_B$ at Q$^2>$1.4 (GeV/c)$^2$ for $x_B>$ 1.5 where the inclusive cross section depends primarily on the high-momentum components of the nuclear wave function. The observed scaling shows that the momentum distributions at high-momenta have the same shape for all nuclei and differ only by a scale factor. The observed onset of the scaling at Q$^2>$1.4 and $x_B >$1.5 is consistent with the kinematical expectation that two nucleon short range correlations (SRC) are dominate the nuclear wave function at $p_m\gtrsim$ 300 MeV/c. The values of these ratios in the scaling region can be related to the relative probabilities of SRC in nuclei with A$\ge$3. Our data demonstrate that for nuclei with A$\geq$12 these probabilities are 5-5.5 times larger than in deuterium, while for $^4$He it is larger by a factor of about 3.5.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved. Nuclear dynamics at short distances is one of the most fascinating topics of strong interaction physics. The physics of it is closely related to the understanding of the role of the QCD in generating nuclear forces at short distances, as well as of the dynamics of the superdense cold nuclear matter relevant to the interior of neutron stars. The emergence of high-energy electron and proton beams has led to significant recent progress in high-energy nuclear scattering experiments investigating the short-range structure of nuclei. These experiments, in turn, have stimulated new theoretical studies resulting in the observation of several new phenomena specific to the short-range structure of nuclei. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in studies of short-range correlations in nuclei and discuss their importance for advancing our understanding of the dynamics of nuclear interactions at short distances.},

abstract = {This well-known introductory textbook gives a uniform presentation of nuclear and particle physics from an experimental point of view. The first part, Analysis, is devoted to disentangling the substructure of matter. This part shows that experiments designed to uncover the substructures of nuclei and nucleons have a similar conceptual basis, and lead to the present picture of all matter being constructed from a small number of elementary building blocks and a small number of fundamental interactions. The second part, Synthesis, shows how the elementary particles may be combined to build hadrons and nuclei. The fundamental interactions, which are responsible for the forces in all systems, become less and less evident in increasingly complex systems. Such systems are in fact dominated by many-body phenomena. A section on neutrino oscillations and one on nuclear matter at high temperatures bridge the field of "nuclear and particle physics" and "modern astrophysics and cosmology". The fourth edition includes new developments, in particular a new section on the double beta decay including a discussion of the possibility for a neutrinoless decay and its implications for the standard model. The concise text is based on lectures held at the University of Heidelberg. It has been translated into many languages and has become a standard reference for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses and includes numerous exercises with worked answers. Book jacket.},

The data confirm that the structure functions of the nucleon measured in nuclei are different from those measured on quasi-free nucleons in deuterium. The kinematic range of the data is such that 〈Q2〉 ∼ 5 GeV2 at x ∼ 0.03, increasing to 〈Q2〉 ∼ 35 GeV2 for x ∼ 0.65. The measured cross section ratios are less than unity for x ≲ 0.05 and for 0.25 ≲ x < 0.7. The decrease of the ratio below unity for low x becomes larger as A increases as might be expected from nuclear shadowing. However, this occurs at relatively large values of Q2 (∼ 5 GeV2) indicating that such shadowing is of patrionic origin. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {We discuss the nuclear EMC effect with particular emphasis on recent data for light nuclei including 2H, 3He, 4He, 9Be, 12C and 14N. In order to verify the consistency of available data, we calculate the \chi^2 deviation between different data sets. We find a good agreement between the results from the NMC, SLAC E139, and HERMES experiments. However, our analysis indicates an overall normalization offset of about 2% in the data from the recent JLab E03-103 experiment with respect to previous data for nuclei heavier than 3He. We also discuss the extraction of the neutron/proton structure function ratio F2n/F2p from the nuclear ratios 3He/2H and 2H/1H. Our analysis shows that the E03-103 data on 3He/2H require a renormalization of about 3% in order to be consistent with the F2n/F2p ratio obtained from the NMC experiment. After such a renormalization, the 3He data from the E03-103 data and HERMES experiments are in a good agreement. Finally, we present a detailed comparison between data and model calculations, which include a description of the nuclear binding, Fermi motion and off-shell corrections to the structure functions of bound proton and neutron, as well as the nuclear pion and shadowing corrections. Overall, a good agreement with the available data for all nuclei is obtained.},

abstract = {The atomic nucleus is made of protons and neutrons (nucleons), which are themselves composed of quarks and gluons. Understanding how the quark–gluon structure of a nucleon bound in an atomic nucleus is modified by the surrounding nucleons is an outstanding challenge. Although evidence for such modification—known as the EMC effect—was first observed over 35 years ago, there is still no generally accepted explanation for its cause 1–3 . Recent observations suggest that the EMC effect is related to close-proximity short-range correlated (SRC) nucleon pairs in nuclei 4,5 . Here we report simultaneous, high-precision measurements of the EMC effect and SRC abundances. We show that EMC data can be explained by a universal modification of the structure of nucleons in neutron–proton SRC pairs and present a data-driven extraction of the corresponding universal modification function. This implies that in heavier nuclei with many more neutrons than protons, each proton is more likely than each neutron to belong to an SRC pair and hence to have distorted quark structure. This universal modification function will be useful for determining the structure of the free neutron and thereby testing quantum chromodynamics symmetry-breaking mechanisms and may help to discriminate between nuclear physics effects and beyond-the-standard-model effects in neutrino experiments.},

abstract = {We have carried out an experimental study of the neutron and proton deep-inelastic electromagnetic structure functions. The structure functions were extracted from electron-proton and electron-deuteron differential cross sections measured in three experiments spanning the angles 6°, 10°, 15°, 18°, 19°, 26°, and 34°. We report primarily on the large-angle (15°-34°) measurements. Neutron cross sections were extracted from the deuteron data using an impulse approximation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the nucleon is composed of pointlike constituents. The variation of the cross section with angle suggests that the hypothetical constituents have spin. The data for np, the ratio of the neutron and proton differential cross sections, are in the range 0.25 to 1.0, and are within the limits imposed by the quark model. Detailed studies of the structure functions were made for a range of the scaling variable from =1.3 to =10.0, and for a range of invariant four-momentum transfer Q2 from 1.0 to 20.0 GeV2. These studies indicate that the structure functions approximately scale in the variable, although significant deviations from scaling in are apparent in the region 1.3<<3.3. These deviations from scaling are in the same direction and of similar magnitude for both neutron and proton. The interpretation of the data in terms of various theoretical models is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1979 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We present the results of a phenomenological study of unpolarized nuclear structure functions for a wide kinematical region of x and Q2. As a basis of our phenomenology we develop a model which takes into account a number of different nuclear effects including nuclear shadowing, Fermi motion and binding, nuclear pion excess and off-shell correction to bound nucleon structure functions. Within this approach we perform a statistical analysis of available data on the ratio of the nuclear structure functions F2 for different nuclei in the range from the deuteron to the lead. We express the off-shell effect and the effective scattering amplitude describing nuclear shadowing in terms of few parameters which are common to all nuclei and have a clear physical interpretation. The parameters are then extracted from statistical analysis of data. As a result, we obtain an excellent overall agreement between our calculations and data in the entire kinematical region of x and Q2. We discuss a number of applications of our model which include the calculation of the deuteron structure functions, nuclear valence and sea quark distributions and nuclear structure functions for neutrino charged-current scattering. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Next, different parametrizations of nuclear partonic distributions based on fit analysis to existing data combined with Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution, are reviewed.

@article{arrington_src,
abstract = {Background: The density of the nucleus has been important in explaining the nuclear dependence of the quark distributions, also known as the EMC effect, as well as the presence of high-momentum nucleons arising from short-range correlations (SRCs). Recent measurements of both of these effects on light nuclei have shown a clear deviation from simple density-dependent models. Purpose: A better understanding of the nuclear quark distributions and short-range correlations requires a careful examination of the experimental data on these effects to constrain models that attempt to describe these phenomena. Methods: We present a detailed analysis of the nuclear dependence of the EMC effect and the contribution of SRCs in nuclei, comparing to predictions and simple scaling models based on different pictures of the underlying physics. We also make a direct, quantitative comparison of the two effects to further examine the connection between these two observables related to nuclear structure. Results: We find that, with the inclusion of the new data on light nuclei, neither of these observables can be well explained by common assumptions for the nuclear dependence. The anomalous behavior of both effects in light nuclei is consistent with the idea that the EMC effect is driven by either the presence of high-density configurations in nuclei or the large virtuality of the high-momentum nucleons associated with these configurations. Conclusions: The unexpected nuclear dependence in the measurements of the EMC effect and SRC contributions appear to suggest that the local environment of the struck nucleon is the most relevant quantity for explaining these results. The common behavior suggests a connection between the two seemingly disparate phenomena, but the data do not yet allow for a clear preference between models which aim to explain this connection. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

We argue that the infinite-momentum limit for these commutators does not diverge, but may vanish. If the limit is nonvanishing, we predict $\nu$W2($\nu$,q2)→f2($\nu$q2) and W1($\nu$,q2)→f1($\nu$q2) as $\nu$ and q2 tend to. From a similar analysis for neutrino processes, we conclude that at high energies the total neutrino-nucleon cross sections rise linearly with neutrino laboratory energy until nonlocality of the weak current-current coupling sets in. The sum of $\nu$p and $\nu$p cross sections is determined by the equal-time commutator of the Cabibbo current with its time derivative, taken between proton states at infinite momentum. {\textcopyright} 1969 The American Physical Society.},

We focus on the interpretation of measurements of the EMC effect for valence quarks, a reduction in the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) cross-section ratios for nuclei relative to deuterium, and its possible connection to nucleon-nucleon Short-Range Correlations (SRC) in nuclei. Our review and new analysis (involving the amplitudes of non-nucleonic configurations in the nucleus) of the available experimental and theoretical evidence shows that there is a phenomenological relation between the EMC effect and the effects of SRC that is not an accident. The influence of strongly correlated neutron-proton pairs involving highly virtual nucleons is responsible for both effects. These correlated pairs are temporary high-density fluctuations in the nucleus in which the internal structure of the nucleons is briefly modified. This conclusion needs to be solidified by the future experiments and improved theoretical analyses that are discussed herein.},

This lead us to the phenomenological observation that the ratio of the slopes in the 0.3 < x_B < 0.7 EMC data scale as the ratio of the x_B > 1 nuclear scaling plateaus. Using this correlation, we developed a phenomenological relation which reproduces the general trends and features of the EMC effect for nuclei from 3He to 56Fe.},

abstract = {We report new values of the proton and deuteron structure functions F2(x, Q2) based on a global analysis of eight SLAC experiments on deep inelastic e-p and e-d scattering. These functions were determined over the entire SLAC kinematic range: 0.06≤x≤0.9 and 0.6≤Q2≤30.0 (GeV/c)2. The data are compared with high-Q2 measurements of F2(x, Q2) made in deep inelastic $\mu$-p and $\mu$-d scattering experiments at CERN. New results for the ratio Fn2 Fp2 are also reported. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {This review outlines our present experimental knowledge and theoretical understanding of deep-inelastic scattering on nuclear targets. The emphasis is primarily on nuclear coherence phenomena, such as shadowing, where the key physics issue is the exploration of hadronic and quark-gluon fluctuations of a high-energy virtual photon and their passage through the nuclear medium. New developments in polarized deep-inelastic scattering on nuclei are also discussed, and more conventional binding and Fermi motion effects are summarized. The report closes with a brief outlook on vector meson electroproduction, nuclear shadowing at very large Q2 and the physics of high parton densities in QCD. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.
