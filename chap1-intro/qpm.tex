\item Decide how "historical" to be
\item Hadrons are composed of quarks
\item Quarks are bound by gluons (strong force)
\item Gluons create the "sea" via $g\rightarrow q\bar{q}\rightarrow g$
\item Electric and Magnetic form factors?

The Quark-Parton Model describes the composition of hadrons, both baryons and mesons. Prior to 1964, it was believed that hadrons were as small as it got. However, the adherence of hadrons to the eight-fold way, a categorization of hadrons by charge and strangeness, suggested that there was some underlying mechanism that had yet to be discovered.

In 1964, Gell-Mann and Zweig independently suggested that hadrons could be composed smaller elementary particles. Gell-Mann offered the name "quarks" for these constituents.

Furthering the theory, in Novemeber 1974 two separate experiments published the discovery of the (now named) $J/\psi$ particle. The long lifetime of the $J/\psi$ suggested that new physics must be at play. The Quark-Parton Model predicted the existence of a quark symmetric to the strange quark, called the charm quark. It was determined that the $J/\psi$ could be a meson comprised of a charm and anti-charm, suggesting the validity of the model.
