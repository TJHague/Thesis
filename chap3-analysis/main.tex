\section{Yield Calculation}

The MARATHON experiment measured cross section ratios. This method allows us to cancel many systematics that would otherwise plague a full cross section analysis. By taking data for each target at the same kinematics, acceptance effects are identical. This data taking technique means that with reasonable acceptance cuts, a ratio of target yields is wholly equivalent to the ratio of cross sections.

To calculate the yield we use a simple equation:

\begin{equation}
	\text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Counts}}{\text{Scattering Centers} \cdot \text{Livetime}} \cdot \text{Corrections}
\end{equation}

The yield is binned in Bjorken $x$. This chapter will explain the cuts and corrections that go into this calculation.
