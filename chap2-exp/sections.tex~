The \Index{Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC} (\Index{STAR}) experiment is one of two large experiments at the \Index{Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider} (\Index{RHIC}) facility at \Index{Brookhaven National Lab} (\Index{BNL}) in Upton, New York.  RHIC has 6 experimental sites, 4 of which are occupied by STAR, PHENIX, and the two smaller experiments, BRAHMS and PHOBOS.  A perspective view of the STAR experiment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:star}.

\section{\Index{RHIC}}

RHIC accelerates heavy ions through several stages in order to deliver them to the experimental sites.  The Tandem Van De Graff, AGS Booster, AGS, and RHIC ring are all crucial for producing high energy heavy ions (up to 100 GeV/u).

\subsection{Tandem Van De Graff Generator}

Heavy ions are produced in the \Index{Tandem Van De Graff} generator facility.  One of the Tandem generators is dedicated to accelerated ion production for \Index{RHIC}.  The input to the Tandem is an ion source such as a high temperature gold filament, which would produce Au$^{1-}$. The Tandem, which develops a 15.5 MV electrostatic potential, earns its nomenclature from the fact that it accelerates ions before and after passing them through a \Index{stripper foil}, which removes electrons from the incoming ions.  The ions coming out of the Tandem have an energy of 1 MeV/u.  Gold beams leaving the Tandem consist of Au$^{12+}$.  \cite{Roser:02}

\subsection{AGS Booster}

The next stage in the acceleration is the \Index{AGS Booster}, which accelerates ions coming along the \Index{Tandem-to-Booster} (\Index{TtB}) line from the Tandem before delivering them to the \Index{Alternating Gradient Synchrotron} (\Index{AGS}).  The TtB includes another stripper foil to produce Au$^{31+}$ for injection into the Booster.  The Booster is a synchrotron (which accelerates charged particles in a circular path by increasing both the magnetic field intensity and the electric field frequency) with a circumference of 202 m, 1/4 that of the AGS.  

The booster is required because it has superior vacuum to the AGS.  This is important because an ion beam suffers losses from two effects:  electron capture and electron stripping. \cite{Calvani:96}  Electron capture is the dominant effect at low energy, and electron stripping is more important at higher energies.  When low energy ions are injected into the Booster, the good vacuum ($10^{-11}$ Torr) prevents significant beam loss due to electron capture from residual gas.  By the time ions leave the Booster, they are in the energy regime where electron stripping dominates.  On the transfer line from the Booster to the AGS, they are further stripped of their electrons.  Gold, for example, is reduced to Au$^{77+}$, leaving only 2 electrons.
High charge states have lower potential for electron stripping, so the weaker vacuum ($10^{-7}$ Torr) of the AGS still allows good transmission of the ion beam.  Without the Booster, the AGS would not be usable for ions with an atomic mass greater than 28 (silicon); it would loose too much of the incident low energy beam to electron capture.  Ions exiting the booster have momenta of 100 MeV/u.  \cite{Roser:02}

\subsection{Alternating Gradient Synchrotron}

The \Index{AGS} itself is a synchrotron with an 807 m circumference.  It, like the Booster, uses alternating quadrupole magnets to focus the beam.  These quadrupoles cause a gradient in the magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction.  The net transverse magnetic field is zero at the center, so ions which are on the ideal circular path in the synchrotron are not diverted.  Ions which have drifted away from the center are focused in an ellipse by the quadrupole.  The subsequent quadrupole magnet is rotated by 90 degrees so that the beam is compressed along the other transverse axis.  This strong (alternating) focusing technique earns the AGS its name.  The AGS accelerates ions up to 9 GeV/u .   \cite{Roser:02}

\subsection{RHIC Ring}

The beam next passes through \Index{AGS To RHIC} (\Index{ATR}) transfer line, where a filter foil strips Gold of its final two electrons to produce Au$^{79+}$.   At this point, the ion beam is split into bunches by switching magnets.  The bunches are alternately sent down the two RHIC rings (``blue'' and ``yellow'') in opposite directions.  The final acceleration in the RHIC rings is 100 GeV/u for a total $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 200 GeV in a collision.   \cite{Roser:02}  The collider has a design luminosity of $L=2 \times 10^{26}\;cm^{-2}\;s^{-1}$ for Au-Au collisions at this maximum energy.  The circumference of the RHIC ring is 3834 m, which is chosen because it is 19/4 times that of the AGS.  That is the ratio of the number of ion bunches desired in each RHIC ring (57) relative to the number in the AGS (12).  This facilitates injection of ions from the AGS into the RHIC rings.

In RHIC, ion bunches are steered by magnets to cross at the 6 interaction points every 220 ns.  This corresponds to a crossing rate of 4.55 MHz.  Each bunch contains about $7.5 \times 10^8$ ions.  The luminosity is the flux of particle pairs, i.e., the number of particle crossings per unit area per unit time and is equivalent to

\begin{equation}
L = f \frac{N_{1} N_{2}}{A},
\label{eqn:luminosity}
\end{equation}

where f is the frequency of bunch crossing, N$_{1}$ and N$_{2}$ are the number of particles in each intersecting bunch, and A is the transverse area of the interaction region.  So the design luminosity above corresponds to a interaction area of about $A = (4.55 \times 10^6\; s^{-1}) (7.5 \times 10^8)^2 / (2 \times 10^{26}\;cm^{-2}\;s^{-1}) = 0.013\; cm^2$, or a diameter of about 1.3 mm.  The total interaction rate is $L\sigma_{NN}$, where $\sigma_{NN}$, the total Au-Au cross section, is about 7.2 barn.  \cite{Kharzeev:01}  So the interaction rate is about $(2 \times 10^{26}\;cm^{-2}\;s^{-1})(7.2 \times 10^{-24}\;cm^{2})=1440\;Hz$.

\section{\Index{STAR Magnet}}

Momentum determination in the STAR \Index{Time Projection Chamber} (\Index{TPC}) requires a strong, uniform magnetic field.  The magnet strength was designed with a balance between raw field strength and homogeneity.  A strong field is necessary to resolve the curvature (i.e., transverse momentum) of high momentum tracks, but the position resolution is sensitive to inhomogeneity in the field.

The magnet may produce a very uniform field along the $z$ axis over the range 0.25 $< |B_z| <$ 0.5 T.  The non-uniformity in the radial and azimuthal directions are defined by $|\beta_{r/\phi}| \equiv |\int_{z'=210cm}^{z}(B_{r/\phi}/B_{z'})dz'|$.  Over the operating range above, the magnet maintains a uniformity $|\beta_{r}| \leq$ 2.3 mm and $|\beta_{\phi}| \leq$ 1.0 mm over the entire TPC volume.  Weighing in at 1100 tons, the magnet also provides support for all other elements of the STAR detector.  To maintain the field quality above, variations in the magnet structure are less than 1 mm.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/magnet_fig1}
\caption{Section drawing of magnet steel and coil locations.}
\label{fig:magnet}
\end{figure}

One can see the structure of the magnet in Figure \ref{fig:magnet}. It consists of 10 Main coils and two Space Trim coils, all of which are connected in series.  They draw a current of more than 5000 A at the maximum field (0.5 T).  The coils have an inner diameter of 5.3 m and an outer diameter of 6 m.  The axial thickness of the Main coils is 0.45 m, and the Space Trim coils measure 0.23 m.  To help maintain field uniformity, the Pole-tips also contain Trim Coils, which draw a total of 1330 A at maximum field.  All magnet coils are made from rectangular aluminum, insulated with fiberglass and epoxy.

The magnet is water-cooled, and the internal closed-loop cooling system moves 1200 GPM through the heat-exchangers, which are cooled by an external open-loop system.  The system must dissipate the 3.5 MW of power generated by the magnet and keep it at the normal operating temperature of 29$^\circ$ C. \cite{Bergsma:02}

\section{\Index{Trigger and DAQ}}

The STAR \Index{Data AcQuisition} (\Index{DAQ}) electronics are capable of reading out entire events (ion collisions) at the rate of 100 Hz.  As seen above, the bunch crossing rate is about 5 MHz, so some method of detecting events and deciding which ones to read out from DAQ must be found.
The actual Au-Au interaction rate is only about 1/3000 of the bunch crossing rate, so the first job of the trigger is to detect whether an interaction occurred during a bunch crossing.  This is done mainly in the Level 0, 1, and 2 (L0, L1, L2) triggers.  These triggers get input from the ``Fast Detectors'':  a \Index{Central Trigger Barrel} (\Index{CTB}) and two \Index{Zero Degree Calorimeters} (East and West \Index{ZDC}).  These detectors provide per-event information at the rate of 10 MHz, 5 orders of magnitude faster than the ``Slow Detectors'', which include tracking detectors such as the \Index{Time Projection Chamber} (\Index{TPC}), the \Index{Silicon Vertex Tracker} (\Index{SVT}), and the \Index{Ring Imaging CHerenkov} detector (\Index{RICH}).

The CTB consists of 4 cylindrical bands, each of which contain 60 scintillator slats.  (See Figure \ref{fig:ctb}.)  It surrounds the TPC at a radius of 2 m.  It covers the full azimuthal range and the pseudorapidity range $-1<\eta<1$.  It serves to measure charged particle multiplicity.  The ZDCs, common to all RHIC experiments, are hadronic calorimeters which use fiber optics to detect Cherenkov light from the core of the hadronic shower.  They are located 18 m away on either side of the interaction region and cover a small solid angle at $\theta=0$ and $\theta=\pi$.  They are behind the dipole magnet, which steers the two RHIC beams back into the ring from the interaction region.  Thus, only neutral particles (primarily neutrons) are detected in the calorimeters.  Each ZDC has 3 modules, and both ZDC signals are summed to determine if an interaction occurred.  The ZDCs can be used to estimate the longitudinal position of the collision vertex by comparing the timing of the signals from the East and West modules.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/fig2_ctb}
\caption{Diagram of Central Trigger Barrel}
\label{fig:ctb}
\end{figure}

These fast detectors provide information to the Trigger hardware every time a bunch crossing occurs.  The basic ``Hadronic Minimum Bias'' (\Index{minbias}) trigger is an L0 trigger that simply requires coincidence of signals in both the East and West ZDCs.  This is designed to collect as many events as possible while introducing little bias with respect to centrality, etc.  The ``Central'' \index{central} trigger is also a fast L0 trigger; it is designed to capture higher multiplicity events (i.e., more central collisions).  It requires either a high CTB count alone or high counts in the CTB and ZDCs.  The option exists because, for the most central collisions, few particles are produced at small polar angle, and the ZDC signal is small.  (See Figure \ref{fig:zdc_ctb}.)  The L0 trigger is programmed to trigger on a given number of Central and Minbias events in accordance with the data requirements of STAR.  Once the conditions for an L0 trigger have been met, the various slow detectors begin digitizing their data.  This takes several milliseconds, and during this time, the L1 and L2 triggers perform more comprehensive analysis of the output from the fast detectors.  More complicated selections may be made, and the event may be aborted if it does not not meet the L1 and L2 trigger requirements.  This causes the slow detectors to stop digitizing and prepare for another L0 trigger.  \cite{Bieser:02}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/fig4_zdcctb}
\caption{ZDC sum versus CTB signal}
\label{fig:zdc_ctb}
\end{figure}

The Level 3 (L3) trigger uses data from the slow detectors once it is digitized and actually performs a fast reconstruction of the event.  This means that the L3 trigger software turns the pixel information from the tracking detectors into particle trajectory information, and ultimately particle identification (\Index{PID}) data.  It can then accept or reject the event on more complicated triggers such as the position of the interaction vertex, the particle multiplicity, or individual particle momenta.  The L3 reconstruction allows the immediate display of events in the STAR control room.  \cite{Adler:02}

\section{TPC}

The \Index{Time Projection Chamber} (\Index{TPC}) is the main tracking detector in STAR.  It is the largest such detector in the world to date, having a diameter of 4 m and a length of 4.2 m.  It provides full tracking out to $\pm$ 1.8 units of pseudorapidity and can identify particles with transverse momenta down to 100 MeV.  As particles traverse the P10 gas (90\% Argon, 10\% Methane) which fills it, they ionize gas molecules.  The central membrane of the TPC is held at -31 kV, and the endcaps are grounded; this creates a very uniform longitudinal electric field.  The electron from the ionized gas molecule drifts down to the end of the TPC until it reaches the pad planes (see Figure \ref{fig:pad_plane}).  The 2 pad planes each consist of 12 sectors.  Each sector has 45 rows of pads.  The sectors are divided into inner (60 $<$ R $<$ 127 cm) and outer (127 $<$ R $<$ 189 cm) subsectors.  

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/padplane}
\caption{The anode pad plane, 1 sector of 24 (12 east and 12 west)}
\label{fig:pad_plane}
\end{figure}

The pads are in fact \Index{MultiWire Proportional Chamber}s (\Index{MWPC}s), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mwpc}.  In normal operation, the drifting electron is accelerated toward the anode wires until it has enough energy to ionize another gas molecule.  Both electrons are accelerated, ionizing more gas molecules, and so on.  Near the 20 $\mu m$ anode wires, the electrons are subject to a very high electric field and are strongly accelerated.  This avalanche deposits charge on  the anode wires when the electrons are grounded out there.  This charge induces a current in the pad below the wire; the induced current is the raw data measured by the TPC.  The benefit of the Argon in P10 gas is that it is easily ionized.  The Methane acts as a quencher.  Gas molecules excited by the drifting electrons may revert to a ground state, emitting an energetic photon.  Without a quencher, this photon would cause further ionizations in the TPC volume, leading to additional avalanches which were not caused by particles in the event.  An organic quencher is a highly efficient absorber of these photons, and it ensures that the only avalanches come from primary electrons due to ionization by a particle produced in the event.  The innermost set of wires in the MWPC is the gating grid, which keeps electrons from entering the avalanche region until the TPC is ready to take data and keeps positive ions from the avalanches from drifting into the TPC drift volume, where they could distort the precise electric field.  An electron from a primary ionization may have to drift as much as 2 m before reaching the pad plane to be detected.  The electric field in the drift volume must be as homogeneous as possible.  

These MWPCs operate in proportional mode, meaning that the gain is in a moderate region where the charge deposited on the pad goes linearly with the magnitude of the ionization produced in the drift volume.  That means that the total charge deposited by an ionizing particle on the pad plane is proportional to the amount of energy loss (dE/dx) it incurred while passing through the TPC.  This quantity depends mainly on the velocity of the particle (not the momentum), and so it can be used with some success to differentiate particle species in the region where the momentum does not greatly exceed the mass.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/outer_wires}
\caption{The wires in the MWPC for an outer sector pad}
\label{fig:mwpc}
\end{figure}

The TPC provides three dimensional data.  The pad spacing along a row is 3.35 mm (Inner sector) or 6.75 mm (outer sector).  The spacing of the padrows is 50 mm (inner sector) or 20 mm (outer sector).  Total density is limited by electronic readout capability.  The geometry above represents a balance between better energy loss (dE/dx) information in the outer sector, and better space point resolution in the inner sector.  The high pad density along the inner sector padrows places a limitation on the number of rows which can be served by the readout electronics; thus the density of padrows is lower here.  The z position is determined by the time the primary electrons take to drift from the original ionization point.  Data is recorded in up to 512 ``time buckets'', each corresponding to about 1 cm in z (based on the drift velocity determined by the electric field).  The spatial information can have higher resolution than the spacing of pads or time buckets.  One may fit a Gaussian to adjacent pads or time buckets to find the center of the distribution.  Resolution along the padrow is about 0.4 mm in the inner sector and 0.6 mm in the outer sector.  That along the drift direction is 0.9 mm in the inner sector and 1.2 mm in the outer.  These are for particle trajectories which cross the padrow at right angles.  Polar or azimuthal inclination will increase the uncertainty in the drift and padrow directions, respectively, because the distribution of charge at the anode planes will be spread out over several pads or time buckets.  The maximum resolution in the radial direction is fixed at the padrow width because no finer position information is available.  There is an inherent uncertainty in position because of the diffusion of a cloud of electrons produced by an ionizing particle as it drifts through the TPC to the pad plane.  The transverse diffusion is about 3.3 mm for electrons which drift the maximum 210 cm.  The longitudinal diffusion is about 5.2 mm.  \cite{Anderson:02}

\section{SVT}

The \Index{Silicon Vertex Tracker} (\Index{SVT}) is located near the beam line at mid-rapidity.  It is designed to improve the TPC tracking in several ways; it improves the primary vertex resolution, track separation resolution, and energy loss measurement for particle identification.  It also adds new capability such as the reconstruction of decays of short-lived particles like strange and multi-strange baryons because it provides secondary vertexing capability very close to the collision vertex.  Being at a smaller radius, it also allows the measurement of lower momentum particles by reconstructing particle trajectories solely with the SVT.

The SVT consists of 3 concentric barrels, each covering approximately the same pseudorapidity (-1 $<$ $\eta$ $<$ 1).  Each barrel has a number (8, 12, or 16 for barrels 1, 2, and 3, respectively) of ladders, which extend in the axial direction, and each ladder contains a number of \Index{Silicon Drift Detector} (\Index{SDD}) wafers (4, 6, or 7 for barrels 1, 2, or 3).  Each 63 mm square SDD wafer is effectively a solid state drift chamber.  It is made of an n-type Silicon semiconductor 280 $\mu m$ thick, and several p-type cathode strips (located every 135 $\mu m$ in the drift direction) are placed on the top and bottom of each wafer.  When negative voltage is applied to the cathodes, free electrons caused by ionization from energetic particles passing through the wafer will be attracted to n-type anodes at the edge of the wafers.  The anodes are at a 250 $\mu m$ pitch (perpendicular to the drift direction).  The negatively charged p-type cathodes on the top and bottom surfaces constrain the electrons produced through ionization to the center of the wafer.

The cathode pitch maintains a uniform electric field, allowing the determination of position in the drift direction by a measurement of drift time.  The overall position resolution of the SVT is 20 $\mu m$, much more precise than that of the TPC. \cite{Bellwied:02}
