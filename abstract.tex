%MARATHON is a Deep Inelastic Scattering experiment in Jefferson Lab's Hall A. The experiment utilized Deuterium, Helium-3, and Tritium targets to extract the $F_2^n/F_2^p$ structure function ratio and R. \textbf{Need to give an explanation of R. Talk about EMC and why we're looking at these things. Mention uniqueness of having Tritium target}

The MARATHON experiment ran in Hall A of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). This experiment used a $10.59$ GeV electron beam to measure the ratio of the $F_2$ structure functions of Helium-3 and Deuterium. Data was recorded in the kinematic range of $0.195 \leq x \leq 0.825$, $2.5\ \left(\text{Gev}/c\right)^2 \leq Q^2 \leq 13\ \left(\text{Gev}/c\right)^2$, and $3.5\ \left(\text{Gev}/c^2\right)^2 \leq W^2 \leq 13\ \left(\text{Gev}/c^2\right)^2$. This is the first measurement of the $^3$He EMC effect that is purely in the Deep Inelastic Scattering region. Minimal light nuclear EMC data is currently available. This measurement is an essential component to uncovering the nature of the EMC effect.
