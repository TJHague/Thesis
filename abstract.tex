My research field is experimental nuclear physics.  My work was  ------


We present the details of the  analysis, the obtained distributions, and their discussion.

MARATHON is a Deep Inelastic Scattering experiment in Jefferson Lab's Hall A. The experiment utilized Deuterium, Helium-3, and Tritium targets to extract the $F_2^n/F_2^p$ structure function ratio and R. \textbf{Need to give an explanation of R. Talk about EMC and why we're looking at these things. Mention uniqueness of having Tritium target}
